# MachineLearning-Regression-House-Price-Prediction

# Objective: To predict the sale price of the house based on the certain parameters.
# Data Preprocessing: Utilised python libraries like pandas, numpy, Sci-kit learn, matplotlib etc to clean and preprocess the data. Featurre engineering was applied to some of the features in order to make the model more efficient.
# Models: Models were build using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor. Random search CV algorithm was used for hyperparameter tuning and estimating the best parameters for the model. The final model was then trained on those hyperparameters.
# Performance Matrix: The model was estimated on Mean Squarred Error value and Mean Absolute Error value.
# Front-end: The frontend part was developed using Streamlit framework.
